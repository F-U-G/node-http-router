# Node.js HTTP Router

This is a simple HTTP router. I made this for my own learning purposes and I might add random things to it in the future(like a DB).

## Usage

- Run `npm install` 
- Create a .env file and put `PORT=3000' in it(or any port number you want). 
- run `npm start`

### request.http

This file holds all HTTP tests.


### server.js

Routes:
- '/' -> index.html
- '/About' -> about.html
- '/api/test' -> test api JSON, hardcoded into server.js for now
